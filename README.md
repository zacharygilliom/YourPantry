# YourPantry
A small program where you can enter in your ingredients you have in your kitchen and it will search for matching recipes based on the ingredients.

It will also create a small database using mongoDB to store all your ingredients on your pc so you can login and log out and save all your ingredients for next time.

Still in testing.
